## Overview

The Movie Recommender System is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that suggests movies based on user input. Utilizing advanced recommendation algorithms, it offers personalized movie recommendations by analyzing similarities among films in a dataset. The application features a clean interface, dynamic recommendations, and informative movie posters fetched from Wikipedia.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can type or select a movie from a dropdown menu.
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Once a movie is selected, the system recommends similar movies based on a trained model.
- **Movie Posters**: Fetches and displays movie posters from Wikipedia, with a fallback option for missing posters.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to provide a seamless experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **FuzzyWuzzy**: For fuzzy string matching to improve search accuracy.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping to retrieve movie posters from Wikipedia.
- **Pickle**: For loading pre-trained models and datasets.
